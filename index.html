      <h2>An Artist's Showcase</h2>
      <h3>The website I made for Frederick R McDonald</h3>
      <p>Frederick R McDonald is an international, award-winning artist: painter,
        poet and photographer who lives in Fort McMurray, Alberta (Canada). Fred
        predominantly sells his paintings directly to collectors and he wanted a
        website to showcase his new artworks as well as his impressive career.
      </p>
      <p>UX is the foundation of any site and I started this one with secondary
        research into the buying behaviour of art collectors. From there I
        structured the information architecture, followed by wireframes. I also
        crafted the copy, guided by the research. The fully customised coding
        began with the smartphone version first, using semantic HTML5, and I
        achieved the tablet and desktop layouts using the flexbox and CSS grid
        frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>The site design provides a preview of his new artworks, just ahead of an
        exhibition. It highlights the artworks that are held in prominent art
        collections as an illustration of his importance in the Canadian art world.
        The site also includes several previously unpublished poems. Fred is an
        established cultural leader and this site draws attention to his many
        achievements in the worlds of art and publishing, academically and in his
        community.

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Formerly an international, award-winning artist I was looking to develop my
        creative skills in a new direction when I discovered Skillcrush, the online
        coding school with a heart. Since then I've learned:
        <ul>
          <li>Responsive Website Development</li>
            <ul>
              <!--use clever (paw print) icons as bullet points here-->
              <li>CSS Flexbox</li>
              <li>CSS Grid</li>
            </ul>
          <li>User Experience Research + Design</li>
          <ul>
            <!--use clever (paw print) icons as bullet points here-->
            <li>Quantitative and qualitative research</li>
            <li>Prototyping</li>
            <li>Usability Testing</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
       </p>

      <p>
        Some of my previous skills are also proving useful in my new career:
        bricks and mortar store design, newspaper and magazine writing,
        behavioural science studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making has always been my thing - whether it's art, clothing, jewellery,
        herbal medicines or growing my own food. I love to cook - and help others
        have the necessities to cook (by volunteering at a foodbank). I've even
        worked on fishing boats - testing an invention to prevent porpoise
        by-catch so the local inshore fishery could be kept open. Food security FTW!
      </p>
